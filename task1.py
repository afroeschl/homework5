"""
Write a python script which creates a plot of the function given by eq. (1) in 'main.ipynb'.

Use the following parameters in your implementation:
- Initial velocity: v0 = 80 km/h
- Initial angle: theta = 45°
- g = 9.81 m/s²

Your script should carry out the following tasks:
- Create a list of x-coordinates with 50 equidistant values in the range (0,d) (see eq.(2) in 'main.ipynb')
- Create a list containing f(x) by evaluating the function (eq. (1)) at each of the 50 x-coordinates
- Print the x and y values to the console according to this format (example values follow):
    x = 0.000 m, y = 0.000 m
    x = 0.509 m, y = 0.504 m
    x = 1.018 m, y = 0.997 m
    ...
- Plot the data in your lists using 'matplotlib'
- Your plot must have expressive labels for the title and axes including physical quantities (e.g. 'distance (m)')
- The plotted graphic MUST be saved as a figure named 'task1.png'.
